# ü¶Ä Crab Classification and Detection - Deep Learning Project

### Overview  
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify and detect crabs based on species, size, or other characteristics from image or tabular data. The goal is to build an accurate model that can assist in ecological studies, species monitoring, or fisheries management.

### ‚ú® Features  
- **Image Classification**:  
  - Classifies crab images into different species or categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
- **Object Detection**:  
  - Detects and localizes crabs in images using state-of-the-art detection models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN.  
- **Tabular Data Analysis**:  
  - Predicts crab species or attributes (e.g., weight, shell type) based on structured data.  
- **Transfer Learning**:  
  - Fine-tunes pre-trained deep learning models for improved performance with smaller datasets.  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Displays classification results, bounding boxes, and performance metrics.
